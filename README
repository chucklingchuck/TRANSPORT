1D TRANSPORT V.1.1

Committed 1/29/14 to GITHUB (username: chucklingchuck)

Build instructions
------------------
The following libraries are needed:
-BLAS (http://www.netlib.org/blas/)
-LAPACK (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/)
-ARMADILLO (http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html)
-HDF5 (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html)
-GFORTRAN (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran)
After installing the libraries:
1) Go into MAKEFILE and change the library paths as needed.
2) Run 'MAKE' to generate the executable 'TRANSPORT'
3) Run executable by typing './TRANSPORT' into the terminal.
4) The input file 'input_xml' must be in the same folder.
5) If desired, run the Matlab postprocessor 'post_proc.m' which reads in the generated HDF5 files.

V.1 (previous release)
----------------------
1) LDFE and LDFE-EQ angular quadratures.
2) Region definitions.
3) LDFE spatial discretization.
4) One-to-one mapping across region.
5) XML input parser.
6) HDF5 output of angular flux.

V.1.1 (previous release)
-----------------------
1) Fixed bug in LDFE angular quadratures.
2) Removed LDFE-EQ angular quadratures because the new LDFE angular quadratures are inherently equal-weighted.
3) Added isotopic and anisotropic scattering using source iteration.
4) Added external source option.
5) Added Matlab post-processor for calculating balance parameter.
6) HDF5 output of problem definitions required to calculate balance parameter.

V.2 (current release)
---------------------
1) Added Matlab post-processor ability to plot selected angular flux across the problem domain.
2) Added Matlab post-processor ability to plot scalar moments across problem domain.
3) Added Matlab post-processor ability to plot angular flux at selected interfaces.

Plans for V.3
--------------
1) Investigate and add mapping methods to pass angular psi between regions with different quadrature orders.

Plans for V.4
-------------
1) Investigate and add angular adaptive multigrid methods.

Plans for V.5
-------------
1) Investigate smooth-discontinuous quadrature interpolation.

Plans for V.5+
--------------
1) Implement OpenMP to multi-thread sets of directions.
2) Investigate and add aggregation and scheduling methods minimizing solve times.

Pipedreams
----------
1) Extend into 2D geometry!
