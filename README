1D TRANSPORT V.1.1

Committed 1/29/14 to GITHUB (username: chucklingchuck)

Build instructions
------------------
The following libraries are needed:
-BLAS (http://www.netlib.org/blas/)
-LAPACK (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/)
-ARMADILLO (http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html)
-HDF5 (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html)
-GFORTRAN (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran)
After installing the libraries:
1) Go into MAKEFILE and change the library paths as needed.
2) Run 'MAKE' to generate the executable 'TRANSPORT'
3) Run executable by typing './TRANSPORT' into the terminal.
4) The input file 'input_xml' must be in the same folder.
5) If desired, run the Matlab postprocessor 'post_proc.m' which reads in the generated HDF5 files.

V.1 (previous release)
----------------------
1) LDFE and LDFE-EQ angular quadratures.
2) Region definitions.
3) LDFE spatial discretization.
4) One-to-one mapping across region.
5) XML input parser.
6) HDF5 output of angular flux.

V.1.1 (current release)
-----------------------
1) Fixed bug in LDFE angular quadratures.
2) Removed LDFE-EQ angular quadratures because the new LDFE angular quadratures are inherently equal-weighted.
3) Added isotopic and anisotropic scattering using source iteration.
4) Added external source option.
5) Added Matlab post-processor for calculating balance parameter.
6) HDF5 output of problem definitions required to calculate balance parameter.

Remaining plans for V.2
-----------------------
1) Add simple mapping algorithms to allow for regions with different quadrature order.
2) Add simple adaptive angular schemes.

Plans for V.3
--------------
1) Investigate alternative mapping algorithms.
2) Investigate alternative adaptive schemes.
3) Investigate smooth-discontinuous quadrature interpolation.
3) Implement OpenMP to multi-thread sets of directions.
4) Investigate aggregation and scheduling schemes minimizing solve times.

Pipedreams
----------
1) Extend into 2D geometry.
